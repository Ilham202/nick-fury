The project is just a frontend demo of an E-commerce web site.
The index.html is the home page and a user can log-in or register by clicking on the links in the navigation bar.
All other pages are linked with the home page.
You can add an item by clicking on "Add to cart" button below every accessory which will the item in cart. Now u can click on the "cart-icon" visible in the navigation bar on the top right corner.
It wil show you the materials added to cart.
You can remove them or proceed to checkout by clicking on either of the buttons.
The log-in and Registration page have validations which I implemented using javascript and the cart functionality.
